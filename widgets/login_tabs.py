"""
Prism GUI — "Open login tabs", the one way every screen does it
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The sidebar's Login tabs, Settings' Open login tabs and the setup wizard's
button all open the same sign-in tabs. Each used to call the engine on the UI
thread itself: the window froze while Chrome's profile was copied, and an
error went nowhere, so on a fresh Windows 10 install the button "didn't do
anything" (09-Oct-2026). They all come here now — the tabs open on a
LoginTabsWorker, and the person is always told what happened: the tabs
opened, there was nothing to open, or the real error.
